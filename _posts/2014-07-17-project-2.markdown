For many disabled people, juggling time, energy and money is an equation that simply does not add up. Spoon Theory puts the player in the shoes of Chloe, a young woman with lupus, and charges them with this equation. Student-led project, got an A. I lead the team using a SCRUM format, attended weekly meetings with executives, both overview timelines and sprint-to-sprint planning. Programmed minigames, cutscenes, created and implemented all animations seen in-game.
