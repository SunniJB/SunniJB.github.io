Raccoon Tale is a charming 2D puzzle platformer aimed at casual players, with a unique combination of stealth, physics based puzzles and pacifism - a non-violent approach to stealth gameplay. The game is completely text-less as well, for everyone to enjoy! For Raccoon Tale I was in primary charge of animation, level design and narrative design, with a programming role in boss fight and platforming mechanics. I was also responsible for documentation; meeting minutes and game design document.
